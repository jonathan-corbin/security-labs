# Security Research & Lab Writeups

This repository contains my personal technical notes and structured writeups from
authorized cybersecurity labs and training platforms.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Document what I learn in a consistent way  
- Improve technical reasoning and troubleshooting skills  
- Preserve reproducible steps for future reference  
- Build a clear habit of analysis and documentation  

## What’s in this repo
Each writeup typically includes:
- Enumeration and discovery steps  
- Key technical observations  
- Commands and methodology used  
- Notes on why things worked (or failed)  
- Short lessons learned  

## Scope
All work documented here was performed **only** in legal, authorized environments.
No real systems were accessed without permission.

These notes are for personal learning and technical research, not for production use.
